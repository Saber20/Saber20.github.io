		<H2>A quick flash about my self</H2>
		<p>My name is Saber Rasheed I'm 21 years old, I'm from a small village in Syria, I spent whole of my life in DC, I studied there English literature first year, I came to KRI in 2013, I worked with some international NGOs before I apply for Re:coded</p>
	</center>
	<p>
		I applied for Re:coded in 2015 because: 
		<ol>
			<li>I like to work in the technology section with a company, organization ...... etc, because I used to work as a data entry for a local foundation and I liked so much.</li>

			<li>I also applied for Re:coded to improve my English skills.</li>

			<li>Of course to meet new people and learn more about the Differences between their cultures and societies and ours.</li>

			<li>And finaly to find a better job after we finish our Re:coded course, in the field I will specialize in whether it is HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby ....... etc.</li>

		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		I joined to Re:coded to find a better job in the future so I will keep learning more abou programming languages, because it will be easer to find job with a good skills and good knowledge about programming languages and of course I will apply for jobs in some position related to programming.
	</p>

	<p>
		My dream is to become a proficient translator and to travel to a lot of countries to know more about their cultures and their societies.
